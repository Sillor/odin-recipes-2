            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Jumbo stuffed shells filled with three types of cheese are 
                    topped with a savory tomato sauce in this family-friendly 
                    pasta dish that'll have everyone coming back for seconds! 
                    These stuffed shells are easy-to-make and always guaranteed 
                    to be a hit. This rich and cheesy comfort-food meal looks 
                    like a deep-dish pizza when it's done. I altered what I was 
                    originally given because I did not like cottage cheese and 
                    added other ingredients that I thought it deserved.

                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
                    <li>While the pasta is cooking, mix ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese, eggs, parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until well combined.</li>

                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are bubbly and the shells are slightly set, 35 to 60 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
